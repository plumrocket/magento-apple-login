## How it works
 
As soon as you configure and enable Apple integration, the Login with Apple button shows up on all login and registration forms on your website. A customer can click the button and be redirected to the Apple ID authentication page on their device. From here, customers will enter their Apple ID and password just as they would on a standard Apple website. The authentication process will be then complete, and users can leverage all features of your website for logged-in users.
 
The extension also provides many other features that you can take advantage of:

* When customers log into your website or app with their Apple account, you get all of the benefits of having that user's Apple profile info. Your website then has access to their name, email address, gender, birthday, current location, and profile photo. You can use this information to offer location-based notifications or even send them birthday cards with coupons.
* Personalize customer experience on your website and win more loyalty by displaying user profile photos throughout your website, retrieved from their Apple accounts. 
* Drive traffic and sales from powerful features like the ability to share products on social media.
* The Apple Login button lets users checkout faster, lowering cart abandonment rates and increasing sales.
 
By providing a seamless sign-in experience for your customers, you create a more positive brand image and strengthen your customer relationships.
